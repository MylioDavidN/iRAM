This document is API specification for the <i>APPM</i> algorithm.
<p>
APPM is an online learning algorithm that can be used in modeling a sequence of
events. This algorithm can be used in predicting the event likely
to occur next. This algorithm outputs top-k predictions. Also, it uses a simple 
temporal model that can be used to compute the likelihood of some event to occur 
within a specified time interval. Using these likelihoods and predictions, a system
can take some useful actions if the likelihood of an event crosses some threshold. </p>

<p>At the core of this algorithm, we use a well known data-compression algorithm called 
Prediction By Partial Matching (PPM). The core PPM algorithm and its implementation is 
attributed to  <a href="http://compression.ru/ds/">Dmitry Shkarin</a>. We have used 
<a href="http://compression.ru/ds/">PPMd variant H</a> and modified it for our purpose. 
We do not make any claim of authorship, ownership or the correctness of the PPMd program. 
We provide this code here only for experimental and non-commercial use only. 
Use this program at your own risks.</p>
